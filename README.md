## Eva Nikolai's Portfolio

With an MS in Business Analytics from the University of Notre Dame ('23), a BBA in Marketing from Kent State University ('22), and experience competing as a Division-I student-athlete, I have developed an analytical skillset, creative problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills. I am excited to leverage my background with my passion for data-driven decision-making and collaborative teamwork to contribute, lead, and continue learning within a business analysis team to help deliver meaningful insights!
