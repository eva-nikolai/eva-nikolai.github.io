**Top 2023 Fashion Trends**
<br><br>

Fashion is an ever-evolving industry, constantly generating excitement and anticipation for the next big trends. In this project, the goal was to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most anticipated fashion trends for 2023. 

The project focused on achieving the following objectives:

* Determine the predominant fashion trend predictions for 2023 
* Scrape data from 10 articles sourced from prominent fashion websites
* Employ text cleaning, topic modeling, and term frequency analysis to derive insights

This project's outcomes can provide guidance to producers, informing their production decisions based on the anticipated trends for the upcoming year, and also empower consumers, enabling them to inform their purchasing choices with the projected trends for the year.

**Population Drivers in the South Bend/ Elkhart Region**
<br><br>

In consultation with the South Bend/ Elkhart Regional Partnership, an institution guiding local business and community development for five counties across Indiana and Michigan, this project identifies the most influential factors affecting population in the region and provides a replicable framework/ data management tool for the Regional Partnership's future usage and website/ dashboard design. 

The project was driven by the following objectives:

* Identify the top Census ACS measured variables with a significant impact on population across the five counties
* Utilize API web scraping, text cleaning, and statistical/ machine learning models to create datasets and extract insights
* Develop a data management tool to support future analyses by the Partnership

**Chicago Airport Departure Delay Predictions**
<br><br>

This project aimed to compare departure delays between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Chicago Midway (MDW) airports, empowering airline consumers to make informed decisions. Given the high volume of flights per day in the "windy city," it is essential for travelers to choose an airport with fewer delays at a given time of year. Using time series data analysis and statistical regression, we conducted an in-depth examination of historical departure delay trends at both airports and made future predictions.

Key project highlights include:

* Utilized web scraping techniques to gather departure delay data from ORD and MDW
* Analyzed 10 years of time-series data using various statistical regression and smoothing methods
* Developed accurate and validated forecasts of departure delays using R and Python

Our comprehensive analysis aims to provide travelers with insights into which airport offers a more efficient and reliable travel experience. By presenting our findings, we empower airline consumers to make informed decisions and enjoy smoother journeys.
