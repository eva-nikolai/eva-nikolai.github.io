<br><br>

Given the high volume of flights per day in Chicago and unique weather conditions that affect the "Windy City", consumers should inform their ticket purchases with which airport is the  most efficient given a certain time of year. Therefore, this project compares departure delays between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Chicago Midway (MDW) to predict which Chicago airport is the most likely to get customers to their final destination on-time. 

| Objectives:

* Utilize web scraping in Python to produce datasets of departure delays from ORD and MDW 
* Analyze most recent 10 years of of delays using various statistical regression and smoothing methods
* Develop accurate and validated forecasts of departure delays using R and Python
