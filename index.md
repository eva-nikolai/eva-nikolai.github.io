**Top 2023 Fashion Trends**
<br><br>

Fashion is an ever-evolving industry, constantly generating excitement and anticipation for the next big trends. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most anticipated fashion trends for 2023. The outcomes can provide guidance to production decisions and empower consumers, enabling them to inform their purchasing choices with the projected trends for the year.

| Objectives:

* Determine the predominant fashion trend predictions for 2023 
* Scrape data from 10 articles sourced from prominent fashion websites
* Employ text cleaning, topic modeling, and term frequency analysis to derive insights

**Population Drivers in the South Bend/ Elkhart Region**
<br><br>

In consultation with the South Bend/ Elkhart Regional Partnership, an institution guiding local business and community development for five counties across Indiana and Michigan, this project identifies the most influential factors affecting population in the region and provides a replicable framework/ data management tool for the Regional Partnership's future usage and their website's dashboard design. 

| Objectives:

* Identify the top Census ACS measured variables with a significant impact on population across the five counties
* Utilize API web scraping, text cleaning, and statistical/ machine learning models to create datasets and extract insights
* Develop a data management tool to support future analyses by the Partnership

**Chicago Airport Performance Predictions**
<br><br>

Given the high volume of flights per day in Chicago and unique weather conditions that affect the "Windy City", consumers should inform their ticket purchases with which airport is the  most efficient given a certain time of year. Therefore, this project compares departure delays between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Chicago Midway (MDW) to predict which Chicago airport is the most likely to get customers to their final destination on-time. 

| Objectives:

* Utilize web scraping in Python to produce datasets of departure delays from ORD and MDW 
* Analyze most recent 10 years of of delays using various statistical regression and smoothing methods
* Develop accurate and validated forecasts of departure delays using R and Python
