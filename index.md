Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project aimed to identify the most anticipated fashion trends for 2023. The analysis was based on 10 articles from renowned fashion news sources, including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan.

The project had the following objectives:

* Determine the prevailing fashion trend predictions for 2023 across various sources
* Gather data by scraping 10 articles from prominent fashion websites
* Employ text cleaning, topic modeling, and term frequency analysis to extract insights

The project's outcomes aimed to inform production decisions for fashion producers and enable consumers to make informed purchasing choices based on the anticipated trends for the upcoming year.
