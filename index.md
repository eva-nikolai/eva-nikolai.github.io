**Top 2023 Fashion Trends**
<br><br>

Fashion is an ever-evolving industry, constantly generating excitement and anticipation for the next big trends. In this project, the goal was to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most anticipated fashion trends for 2023. The analysis drew insights from 10 articles sourced from renowned fashion news platforms, including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan.

The project focused on achieving the following objectives:

* Determine the predominant fashion trend predictions for 2023 across a diverse range of sources
* Collect data by scraping and extracting information from 10 articles sourced from prominent fashion websites
* Employ text cleaning, topic modeling, and term frequency analysis techniques to uncover meaningful insights

The project's outcomes aimed to provide valuable guidance to fashion producers, informing their production decisions based on the anticipated trends for the upcoming year. Additionally, the insights derived from the analysis aimed to empower consumers, enabling them to make informed purchasing choices aligned with the projected fashion trends for 2023.

**Identifying Most Impactful Census Variables on Population in the South Bend/ Elkhart Region**
<br><br>

In collaboration with the South Bend/ Elkhart Regional Partnership, a prominent institution guiding local business and community development for five counties in Indiana and Michigan, this project aimed to identify the most influential factors affecting population dynamics in the region. Additionally, the project aimed to establish a replicable framework for the Partnership to conduct similar analyses using Census data in the future.

The project was driven by the following objectives:

* Provide the Regional Partnership with insights on the top Census ACS measured variables that have a significant impact on population trends across the five counties in the region.
* Develop a scalable and replicable data management tool to support future analyses by the Partnership.
* Utilize advanced techniques such as API web scraping and machine learning models to extract valuable insights from large US Census datasets.

The outcomes of this project aimed to empower the South Bend/ Elkhart Regional Partnership with actionable knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions and strategize community development initiatives based on the identified influential factors impacting population dynamics. Additionally, the replicable data management tool would serve as a valuable resource for the Partnership, facilitating efficient and consistent analyses of Census data in the future and to improve their current Regional Talent Dashboard on their website.

**Chicago Airport Departure Delay Predictions**
<br><br>

This project aimed to compare departure delays between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Chicago Midway (MDW) airports, empowering airline consumers to make informed decisions. Given the high volume of flights per day in the "windy city," it is essential for travelers to choose an airport with fewer delays at a given time of year. Using time series data analysis and statistical regression, we conducted an in-depth examination of historical departure delay trends at both airports and made future predictions.

Key project highlights include:

* Utilized web scraping techniques to gather departure delay data from ORD and MDW
* Analyzed 10 years of time-series data using various statistical regression and smoothing methods
* Developed accurate and validated forecasts of departure delays using R and Python

Our comprehensive analysis aims to provide travelers with insights into which airport offers a more efficient and reliable travel experience. By presenting our findings, we empower airline consumers to make informed decisions and enjoy smoother journeys.
