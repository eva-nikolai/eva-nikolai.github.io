<h4><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h4>
<hr>

With an MS in Business Analytics from the University of Notre Dame ('23), a BBA in Marketing from Kent State University ('22), and experience competing as a Division-I student-athlete, I have a passion for working with people to develop creative, data-driven solutions. 

I am excited to leverage my background to contribute, lead, and continue learning within a business analysis team!
