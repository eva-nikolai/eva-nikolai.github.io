**Top 2023 Fashion Trends**
<br><br>

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project aimed to identify the most anticipated fashion trends for 2023. The analysis was based on 10 articles from renowned fashion news sources, including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan.

The project had the following objectives:

* Determine the prevailing fashion trend predictions for 2023 across various sources
* Gather data by scraping 10 articles from prominent fashion websites
* Employ text cleaning, topic modeling, and term frequency analysis to extract insights

The project's outcomes aimed to inform production decisions for fashion producers and enable consumers to make informed purchasing choices based on the anticipated trends for the upcoming year.

**Identifying Most Impactful Census Variables on Population in the South Bend/ Elkhart Region**
<br><br>

In collaboration with the South Bend | Elkhart Regional Partnership, a prominent institution guiding local business and community development in the South Bend/Elkhart Region, this project aimed to identify the most influential factors affecting population dynamics in the region. Additionally, the project aimed to establish a replicable framework for the Partnership to conduct similar analyses using Census data in the future.

The project was driven by the following objectives:

* Provide the Regional Partnership with insights on the top Census ACS measured variables that have a significant impact on population trends across the five counties in the region.
* Develop a scalable and replicable data management tool to support future analyses by the Partnership.
* Utilize advanced techniques such as API web scraping and machine learning models to extract valuable insights from large US Census datasets.

The outcomes of this project aimed to empower the South Bend | Elkhart Regional Partnership with actionable knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions and strategize community development initiatives based on the identified influential factors impacting population dynamics. Additionally, the replicable data management tool would serve as a valuable resource for the Partnership, facilitating efficient and consistent analyses of Census data in the future and to improve their current Regional Talent Dashboard on their website.

**Predicting the next items in a grocery ordering & delivering app**
<br><br>
Given Instacart's open source dataset, 3 million Instacart Orders, in which there is information of millions of sales transactions that have been made through the app, it is of interest to try to answer some questions regarding hidden patterns within the data.

The purpose of this project is to answer at least one of the questions: Which item will the user add to the basket next?
